# Script for producing results.

>âš¡Warning! A complete run can take multiple **days** and requires an NVIDIA GPU capable system.

Once the dataset is downloaded, modify the `run.sh` script to point to correct paths and simply execute it using `./run.sh`. Pre-collected results for algorithms within this library are included under `docs` directory. Note, `cusparse` is *not* part of our framework.
